Interface & implementation classes

























Test Interfaces

Direct referencing 


Dynamic method dispatch via i/f.
I/F ref can directly(w/o type casting) refer to ANY imple class instance(via up-casting) BUT it can access only those members declared in i/f
Passes IS-A test (via instanceof)

i/f instance ---i/f ref ---> imple cls instance


toString --auto invocation
test_override samples

In case of duplicate data member , in inh hierarchy
Type of reference determines --- which data member will be accessed.
Type of object determines --which method gets invoked.
